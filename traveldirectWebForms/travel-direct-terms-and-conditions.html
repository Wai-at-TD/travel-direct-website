                                    	2.1 When you buy an ATOL protected fight or a flight inclusive holiday from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong. Our ATOL number is 6346.

                                    	We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).”

You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.

                                    	4.1 Price Guarantee: most services are provided “On Request” which means services will need to be confirmed once you pay. Once you have paid and received our confirmation of such service, your travel arrangements will not be subject to any surcharge with the exception of Flight Tax Increases and Surcharges (please read section Cancellations or Changes by Us). We do reserve the right to change our published prices. This does not affect the aforementioned guarantee. Unless otherwise specified, the prices quoted include VAT if applicable. Our VAT No. is 853 9802 93.

If the balance has not been received 10 weeks before departure, we reserve the right to cancel your booking where cancellation fees will apply.

                                    	4.3 Any payment (first and subsequent) will be treated as a non-refundable deposit. This may be necessary to cover flights that require immediate ticketing and other services in similar scenarios.

                                    <p>
                                    	4.4 Payments can be made by debit, credit card or bank transfer. We do not accept cheques. Payment is in UK sterling unless otherwise stated. Credit card payments will be subject to a surcharge which will be specified before payment is made.

                                    	4.6 All documents are usually e-mailed but can be posted free of charge (within the UK) by First Class Royal Mail. However, we strongly recommend paying a £10 fee extra (within the UK) for your Tourist Visas to be sent by a Special Delivery Post. Should you not follow our recommendation, you will bear all responsibility for documents mislaid or lost by the Royal Mail.
                                    </p>

                                    	5.1 Please note that we will require your cancellation or change notice in writing by either e-mail or post. The cancellation or change notice date will be deemed as the day we receive your notification. Until then and after our acceptance, you are liable for your holiday arrangements as initially booked. Only the Lead Client (defined as the person whom all documents are addressed to) can request and/or notify a cancellation or change.

                                    	5.1 Flights: In accordance with deadlines and rules defined into the applicable fare, changes can only be made if conditions permit. Some fares are non-changeable and some allow changes for a fee. Name changes are strictly not allowed and thus will be treated as cancellations. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    	5.2 If you change or cancel your booking with our agreement and subject to availability, the following charges will apply in relation to the total value of the booking, excluding visas, credit card surcharges and pre-paid services (see 5.6).

The policy must cover you against medical expenses but cancellation, loss of personal belongings, liability and other risks should be covered as well. Should you choose not to buy travel insurance, despite this advice, then you undertake on behalf of yourself and all members of your party to indemnify both ourselves, our overseas agents and representatives (where applicable), for any costs that may arise which would otherwise have been met had such insurance cover been taken. If you do not buy suitable travel insurance, you may be asked to buy a local policy at an approximate cost of about £2 per day which will only cover you for medical expenses.

Full details of these rights will be published at EU airports and will also be available from airlines.

Since it is not possible for us to publish detailed information on weather patterns, and weather advice can frequently change, we recommend checking the latest FCO Travel information at www.fco.gov.uk/travel. When a storm or natural disaster occurs, travel and accommodation arrangements may be significantly disrupted. It is extremely difficult to predict with accuracy the actual path, duration or effect severe weather patterns may have and the effects of actual or threatened bad weather and natural disasters are beyond our control. If a storm or natural disaster is forecast to affect your destination, we work with local and international authorities to try to minimise disruption and keep you well informed. It may be that an evacuation of your resort, or a delay or cancellation of your flight to or from the resort may be necessary. In the event of changes, cancellation or curtailment to your holiday due to actual or threatened bad weather, we are not able to offer any REFUND and/or COMPENSATION. You must therefore have adequate travel insurance to cover for the curtailment, cancellation or loss of your holiday. Weather information is subject to change and you should monitor the latest international weather updates issued by the Met Office (UK www.metoffice.gov.uk)
